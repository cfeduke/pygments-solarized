Combines two projects together for both Solarized Dark and Solarized Light for use with Pygments, for those people
who work in both high and low light environments.

## solarized-dark-pygments
Original [solarized-dark-pygments](https://github.com/gthank/solarized-dark-pygments) for dark color scheme. This
has been updated to the names `SolarizedDark` and `SolarizedDark256`.

## solarized-pygment
Original [solarized-pygments](https://github.com/john2x/solarized-pygment) for the light color scheme. This has been
updated to the name 'SolarizedLight' so there is no ambiguity between light and dark styles.
